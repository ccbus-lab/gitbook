## Terms of Service

Welcome to the user interface ("Tool" or "Application") hosted at https://www.pandatool.org, provided by PandaTool ("we", "us", or "our"). This interface provides access to decentralized protocols on various public blockchains (including but not limited to Ethereum), allowing users to create certain compatible digital assets. To use this tool, you must use non-custodial wallet software that allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable third-party terms of service, not this Terms of Service Agreement ("Agreement").

This Agreement explains the terms and conditions under which you may access and use the Tool. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or using the Tool, you represent that you have read, understood, and agree to fully comply with all terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to any terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized to access or use the interface and should not use it.

Note: Please read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Tool. This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration clause and a class action waiver clause, both of which affect your rights in dispute resolution. This Tool is only for you, and you should only access PandaTool if you fully agree to these terms.

### User Eligibility Requirements

**PandaTool explicitly prohibits users from mainland China from using this service**. Users from mainland China should not access or use any services of this tool. Once you use this service, you will be deemed to automatically agree to all contents of this disclaimer.

Additionally, you need to declare that you have at least reached the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) and have full rights, capacity, and authorization to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on your own behalf and on behalf of any company or legal entity that you may access or use the interface for.

You further declare that you are not (a) subject to economic or trade sanctions implemented or enforced by any governmental authority, or designated on any prohibited or restricted party list (including but not limited to lists maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department); or (b) a resident, citizen, or organization in a jurisdiction or territory subject to comprehensive nationwide, regional, or territorial economic sanctions imposed by the United States. Finally, you declare that your access and use of the interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and you will not access or use the interface to conduct, facilitate, or otherwise enable any illegal activities.

Finally, it is emphasized again that **PandaTool does not allow any mainland China users to use it**. All consequences or liabilities arising therefrom are not assumed by this website.

### Modification of Agreement

We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time at our sole discretion. If we make any modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and maintaining the current version in PandaTool's Terms of Service. All modifications become effective upon posting, and your continued access or use of the interface will be deemed confirmation of your acceptance of these modifications. If you do not agree to any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the interface.

### Copyright

We own all intellectual property rights and other rights to PandaTool and its content, including (but not limited to) software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs. These intellectual property rights may be used according to the terms of our copyright license and trademark guidelines.

### Other Rights

We reserve the following rights, which do not constitute our obligations: (a) with or without notice to you, modify, replace, delete, or add to the interface; (b) review, modify, filter, disable, delete, and remove any and all content and information from the interface; and (c) cooperate with any law enforcement, court, or government investigation, order, or third party that requests or directs us to disclose information or content you provide.

### Privacy

When you use PandaTool, we only collect your blockchain wallet address, completed transaction hashes, and token names, symbols, and other information. We do not collect any of your personal information (such as your name or other identifiers that can be associated with you). However, we use third-party service providers who may receive or independently obtain your personal information from publicly available sources. We have no control over how these third parties process your data, and you should review their privacy policies to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information. By accessing and using PandaTool, you understand and agree to our data processing practices and how our service providers handle your information.

The information we collect is used to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crimes and other illegal or harmful activities on PandaTool. To this end, we may share the information we collect with blockchain analysis providers. We only share information with these service providers so they can help us promote the security, safety, and integrity of PandaTool.

Please note that when you use PandaTool, you are interacting with Ethereum or other public blockchains, and the nature of this interaction may make your transaction information transparent. PandaTool cannot control and is not responsible for any information you publicly disclose on the blockchain during your operations.

### Prohibited Activities

You agree not to engage in or attempt to engage in any of the following categories of prohibited activities when using PandaTool:

  * **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Activities that infringe or violate any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary intellectual property rights under any law.

  * **Cyber Attacks:** Attempts to interfere with or damage the integrity, security, or normal operation of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including (but not limited to) deploying viruses and DOS attacks.

  * **Fraud and Misrepresentation:** Attempts to defraud us or any other individual or entity, including (but not limited to) providing any false, inaccurate, or misleading information to illegally obtain others' property.

  * **Market Manipulation:** Any activity that violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations regarding the integrity of trading markets, including but not limited to manipulation techniques such as "pump and dump," "hype and dump," and "wash trading."

  * **Securities and Derivatives Regulation Violations:** Violation of any applicable laws, rules, or regulations regarding securities or derivatives trading, including (but not limited to) unregistered securities offerings and offerings of leveraged or other financial derivatives to retail customers in the United States, mainland China, and other countries or regions.

  * **Any Other Illegal Conduct:** Violation of any applicable laws, rules, or regulations in the United States, mainland China, or other relevant jurisdictions, including (but not limited to) restrictions and regulatory requirements under U.S. or mainland China law.

### Non-Solicited Transactions

You agree and understand that: (a) all transactions you submit through PandaTool are deemed non-solicited transactions, meaning they are initiated only by you; (b) you have not received any investment advice from us in any transaction.

### Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duty

This Tool is a completely non-custodial application, meaning you are fully responsible for the custody of the encrypted private keys of your digital asset wallets. This Agreement is not intended to create or impose any fiduciary duty. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we do not owe any fiduciary duty to you or any other party. If any such duties may exist in law or equity, these duties and obligations are hereby irrevocably waived, released, and eliminated. You further agree that we are only responsible for the obligations and liabilities expressly provided in this Agreement.

### Compliance and Tax Obligations

PandaTool may not be available or applicable in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using PandaTool, you agree that you are solely responsible for complying with all laws and regulations that may apply to you. Specifically, your use of this tool may result in various tax consequences, such as income tax or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for determining whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive, and if applicable, reporting and/or paying the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.

### Risk Assumption

By accessing and using PandaTool, you represent that you are sufficiently sophisticated financially and technically to understand the inherent risks of using cryptocurrency and blockchain-based systems, and have an understanding of the details and complexities of Ether (ETH), so-called stablecoins, and other digital tokens that follow the Ethereum standard (ERC-20).

In particular, you understand that due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation, the market for these digital assets is nascent and very volatile. You understand that anyone can create tokens, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept that you may mistakenly trade these tokens or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they claim, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs.

Additionally, you understand that smart contract transactions are automatically executed and settled, and blockchain-based transactions are irreversible once confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transactions using blockchain-based cryptographic systems like Ethereum are variable and may increase significantly at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risks of choosing to trade in expert mode, which may expose you to potential significant price slippage and higher costs.

In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for these variables or risks, do not own or control this product, and are not responsible for any losses you may suffer while accessing or using this tool. Therefore, you understand and agree to assume all risks arising from using PandaTool tools.
