### II. FAQ

**1. Are the exchange price and ratio fixed?**

**2. What if the exchange hasn't arrived?**

  * Answer: If the status shows complete but you still haven't received the tokens, please join our Telegram group to contact volunteers
  * Telegram volunteer group: <https://t.me/pandatool>

**3. Why is my order still processing?**

  * Answer: Orders are usually confirmed within about 1 minute. If the order shows processing, it may be cached. Refresh the page to check the order status again. Or check your wallet - the crypto assets should have arrived

**4. Does the cross-chain bridge require identity verification or login?**

  * Answer: Absolutely not. PandaBridge has high anonymity. Users only need to connect their wallet to use it, no login required

**5. Can the receiving address be a different address?**

  * Answer: Yes. The tokens you exchange can be received by another wallet address, which also protects user privacy

**6. How does PandaBridge ensure exchange records are not tracked?**

  * Answer: Our receiving and sending addresses have a certain isolation effect. In cross-chain situations, on-chain records can at most trace to our cross-chain bridge address, making it difficult to continue querying further

**7. Is there a limit on single exchange amount?**

  * Answer: Yes. PandaBridge focuses on small crypto asset exchanges. Single exchange amount is between $10-200

**8. Does PandaBridge request wallet authorization from users?**

  * Answer: Absolutely not. PandaBridge uses transfer method and does not obtain any authorization

**9. Why can't I see my previous exchange history?**

  * Answer: History shows the last 30 exchange records by default. Older records are not displayed
