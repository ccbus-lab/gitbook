## PancakeSwap Add/Remove Liquidity Tutorial

PancakeSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on BSC (Binance Smart Chain).

### 1. Open PancakeSwap and Connect Wallet

First, open the PancakeSwap website: <https://pancakeswap.finance/?chain=bsc>, click connect wallet in the upper right corner

### 2. Add Liquidity (Add Pool)

After wallet connection is successful, find "Earn" in the top menu bar, then select "Farm/Liquidity". In the new page that opens, select "My Positions".

Then you will see two token pair prompts, generally speaking, select BNB or USDT on the left, and search to select your own token on the right. After selecting the trading pair, remember to select **"Add V2 Liquidity"**.

The ratio of the two token quantities determines the initial price of the token. For example, adding 1000 USDT and 1000 Panda means the token's listing price is 1U.

### 3. Remove Liquidity (Remove Pool)

Find your liquidity on the liquidity page, click V2 LP, then click "Remove", and select the percentage of liquidity to remove.

### 4. FAQ

**1) How much should I add for the first pool?**
Answer: There's no requirement, generally recommended to have pool larger than 300U or 1 BNB

**2) Trading shows insufficient liquidity?**
Answer: This means there's not enough liquidity in the pool. Single transaction quantity/amount generally cannot exceed 25% of the pool

**3) Can I remove other people's added pool when removing?**
Answer: No. Removing pool only removes your own liquidity portion

**4) What's the difference between V2 and V3?**
Answer: Tokens with features/mechanisms can only add V2. Currently V3 pools only support standard tokens
